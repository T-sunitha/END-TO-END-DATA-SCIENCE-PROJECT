## Task Description

Task Description: End-to-End Data Science Project with Model Deployment

Objective:
Develop a complete machine learning pipeline that includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a RESTful API built with Flask.

 Key Tasks:
1. Data Collection-
Load the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.
Convert it to a structured pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Preprocessing-
Separate features and target variables.
Normalize features using StandardScaler.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Model Building-
Use Random Forest Classifier for classification.
Train the model on the training dataset.
Evaluate accuracy on the test set.
4. Model Serialization-
Save the trained model and scaler using joblib for reuse.
5. API Deployment-
Build a Flask API to serve the model.
Create a POST endpoint /predict to accept feature input and return predictions.
Ensure proper handling of input JSON and output response.
6. Testing-
Test the API using tools like Postman or curl.
Validate predictions against known inputs.
